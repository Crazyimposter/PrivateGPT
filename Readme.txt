Project Summary: PrivateGPT Chat with Your PDF Using Hugging Face LaMini-T5-738M, LangChain, FAISS, and Streamlit.

This project involves creating an interactive chatbot capable of engaging with PDF documents using the Hugging Face LaMini-T5-738M model, leveraging LangChain, FAISS, ,Streamlit and combination of advanced natural language processing models and vector search techniques for efficient processing, retrieval, and user interaction. The key components of the project are:

1. PDF Document Processing: Using LangChain's PyPDFLoader to extract text from PDF files and splitting the text into manageable chunks with RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to optimize processing efficiency.

2. Text Embedding Generation: Employing Hugging Face's sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model, which is downloaded and run locally, to generate high-dimensional embeddings of the text chunks. These embeddings help in understanding and retrieving relevant text segments based on user queries.

3. Vector Database Integration:  Implementing FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) to store and query the text embeddings. This allows for fast and efficient similarity searches, making it possible to quickly find relevant information from large PDF documents.

4. Interactive Chatbot: Developing a user-friendly chatbot interface using Streamlit. This interface leverages the embeddings and FAISS to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries based on the content of the PDFs.

By integrating document processing, advanced NLP models, efficient vector storage, and a Streamlit-based interactive interface, this project delivers a practical solution for engaging with and extracting information from PDF documents.
